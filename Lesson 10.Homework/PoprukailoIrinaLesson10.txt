CREATE TABLE Names
(ID INT IDENTITY (1, 1),
FirstName NVARCHAR(100),

INSERT INTO Names (FirstName,LastName)
SELECT DISTINCT TOP 1000000
      p1.[FirstName],
	  p2.[LastName]
      FROM [Person].[Person] p1
           CROSS JOIN

3) The use of the WITH expression is allowed within 
the scope of a single SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, 
or MERGE statement.
The first difference between using WITH and a subquery is that 
a generalized tabular expression can include references to itself. 
The WITH construction allows to create complex queries 
and multiple levels. WITH is declared as a variable at the beginning 
and allows to refer to yourself throughout the query later.
