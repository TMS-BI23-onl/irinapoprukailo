2. a) Remove the external background and graph background, shadows, column stroke, 
 no need for external signatures, as there are along the horizontal axis, add column values.
   b) Change the chart type to columns. Don't use 3D models.
   c) Change the name of the graph, move the name of the horizontal axis down, 
 make the column names in horizontal orientation, as space allows, 
 or reduce the width of the graph, add column values.
